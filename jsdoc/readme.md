Sample script to learn JSDoc.
We can change the template as well.
To do that, copy the default folder from node_module jsdoc templates in the root folder
Give it some name (the folder)
Change the publish js located inside there
Add that file into the jsdoc config file (jsdoc.json) under opts as "template": "folder name"
